# Receiver app for SMServer

Unnamed as of yet. 

Requires: 
 - json
 - curses
 - textwrap
 
 The variables in lines 7 and 8 are the ones that would need to be changed for each inidividual's needs. 'ip' should be your server's private ip. 'port' is, by default, 8741, even on the app, but if you change it on the app, you'll need to change it here too.
