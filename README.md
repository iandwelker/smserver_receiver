 The variables in lines 8 through 57 are the ones that would need to be changed for each inidividual's needs. The only one that you should need to set is 'ip', and the rest should be able to be left as they are preset, and allow everything to work perfectly. Look at the comment above each variable to see what it does, and whether or not you should bother changing it.
